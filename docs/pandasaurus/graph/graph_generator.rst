Graph Generator
===============

``GraphGenerator`` turns enrichment results into rdflib graphs and applies transitive reduction so you can visualize clean hierarchies.

Use it when:

* You need a graph representation of the enriched DataFrame (for plotting or exporting).
* You want to remove redundant edges before exporting to visualization tools.
